 * 
 * A Processor is a class that does not filter an image, but instead takes a filtered image and 
 * derrives useful information out of it.  It can draw areas of note and other things on the window
 * that controls it, and uses a [INSERT PROCESSOR INTERFACE HERE] class to send useful data values
 * to a special panel in a Window.
 * 
 * It also is given a [INSERT ROBOT COMMUNICATION CLASS HERE] to send data to the robot
 * 
 * TODO Instead of passing in the original image, lets pass in a mask Mat that can be overlayed upon any image the user desires
